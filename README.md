## About the Project
Problem statement:
Meetings often produce valuable decisions and action items, but poor follow-up leads to missed deadlines and lost productivity. Manual tracking is slow, error-prone, and inconsistent, reducing team efficiency in fast-paced environments.

Our Solution?
SECRETARY.AI is a simple tool to help you never lose the momentum of your meetings. It takes a pre-recorded 
audio file, transcribes it, and generates a list of tasks, action plan, and mandatory emails for follow-ups 
all this with just a highly specific prompt.

## Getting Started
To get started with SECRETARY.AI, follow these steps:
i. You'll need to have the React App running first. ()
ii. Once it's up and running, to get the transcription section working, you will have to feed it your own Gemini API key
    go to src-->components-->Product.js--> go to line 146--> const apiKey = "(place your api key here)"

## Get it to run (IN TERMINAL)
1. npm install , this command installs all the dependencies required for the project.
2. npm start , from here you'll be redirected to your localhost server/browser.

This is the page where you will have to upload a prerecorded audio file, and then you will get to see the transcription of the audio file along with the action plan, drafted e-mails and the summary.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
