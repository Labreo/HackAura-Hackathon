## About the Project📚
Problem statement:
Meetings often produce valuable decisions and action items, but poor follow-up leads to missed deadlines and lost productivity. Manual tracking is slow, error-prone, and inconsistent, reducing team efficiency in fast-paced environments.

Our Solution?
SECRETARY.AI is a simple tool to help you never lose the momentum of your meetings. It takes a pre-recorded 
audio file, transcribes it, and generates a list of tasks, action plan, and mandatory emails for follow-ups 
all this with just a highly specific prompt.

## Use Cases:
Secretary.AI is a tool designed for businesses, with an objective to reduce time spent onnotetaking, drafting action plan, making a meeting summary and drafting follow-up E-mails to stakeholders. 
But, it's application is not limited to just business rather, it can be implemented in any form of meeting where you need to keep track of important stuff and deadlines, that's the best part about Secretary.AI.
Use it whenever and however needed, afterall:
                                    "He that keepeth the meeting’s pace shall reap its harvest."
